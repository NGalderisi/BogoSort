# BogoSort
The task we were given for this assignment was to create a program that could sort an int array.
Being that I was familiar with a few basic sorting algorithm concepts, I decided to do the amusing and utterly inefficient method of Bogo sorting.
It's a simple program, I added a few things like a timer and a counter just to see the final count and total time ran on some of the longer arrays.
Also as a side note about my commit messages, I was attempting to get the .gitignore file to work because I had initially not had one. This was our introduction to git so that was not something I was privy to.
